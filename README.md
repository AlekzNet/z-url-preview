# z-url-preview
WordPress Z-URL preview plugin

Originally by [Stuart Millington](http://www.z-add.co.uk/) v2.0.0  https://wordpress.org/plugins/z-url-preview/ 

In this version the following is fixed:
* URLs with `&` are supported
* The proper User-Agent is configured (some sites behave differently if the User-Agent is unknown or wrong)
* Multiple redirections are supported (upto 10)
